## üîß **Verification**

After setting up your environment variables on Render:

1. **Restart your service** on Render
2. **Check the logs** - you should see:
   ```
   üîç Verifying email configuration...
   ‚úÖ Email service is ready to send emails
   ```

If you see errors, the logs will tell you what's wrong.

---

## üß™ **Testing Locally**

1. Copy `.env` file to your local machine
2. Add your email credentials
3. Test with:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/forgot-password \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@example.com"}'
   ```

---

## ‚ö° **Quick Fix: If Still Having Issues**

If you're still getting timeout errors after trying the above:

### **Increase Timeout Settings:**

Add these to your `.env` file (optional, already added in code):
```env
EMAIL_TIMEOUT=30000
```

Or use a different port:
```env
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_SECURE=true
```

## üÜò **Troubleshooting**
